                <p>Trying to figure out which dog breed is right for you? Or maybe you're just curious? This is a list of 15 dog breeds that we have. Just click on the name link and it will direct you to the dog's detailed description from the American Kennel Club's page.

            <!-- Corgi -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/pembroke-welsh-corgi/" alt="AKC: Pembroke Welsh Corgi">Corgi</a></h2>
                <img src="images/corgi.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Corgi"/><br><p>At 10 to 12 inches at the shoulder and 27 to 30 pounds, a well-built male Pembroke presents a big dog in a small package. Short but powerful legs, muscular thighs, and a deep chest equip him for a hard day's work. Built long and low, Pembrokes are surprisingly quick and agile. They can be red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, with or without white markings.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Bernese Mountain Dog -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/" alt="AKC: Bernese Mountain Dog">Bernese Mountain Dog</a></h2>
                <img src="images/bernese.jfif" width="400" height="400" alt="Bernese"/><br><p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Berner' aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather, the Berner's brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of Switzerland.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- German Shepherd -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/german-shepherd-dog/" alt="AKC: German Shepherd">German Shepherd</a></h2>
                <img src="images/gs-puppy.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="German Shepherd"/><br>
                <p>German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but GSDs can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Shih Tzu -->
            <div>

                <img src="images/Shih-Tzu.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Shih Tzu"/><br>
                <p>Shi Tsu (pronounced in the West "sheed-zoo" or "sheet-su"; the Chinese say "sher-zer"), weighing between 9 to 16 pounds, and standing between 8 and 11 inches, are surprisingly solid for dogs their size. The coat, which comes in many colors, is worth the time you will put into it - few dogs are as beautiful as a well-groomed Shih Tzu.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Mini American Shepherd -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miniature-american-shepherd/" alt="AKC: ">Miniature American Shepherd</a></h2>
                <img src="images/miniature-american-shepherd.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Miniature American Shepherd"/><br>
                <p>The Miniature American Shepherd shares many physical traits with its forebear the Australian Shepherd—only on a smaller scale. Females stand between 13 and 17 inches at the shoulder; males range from 14 to 18 inches. Despite their size, Minis are every inch a true herding dog: energetic, versatile, rugged, and extremely bright. The eye-catching coat comes in black, blue merle, red, and red merle. (The merle will exhibit in any amount marbling, flecks, or blotches.) Minis move with the smooth and agile step of a dog built for hard work on punishing terrain.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Golden Retriever -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/" alt="AKC: Golden Retriever">Golden Retriever</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Golden-Retriever.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Golden Retriever"/><br>
                <p> The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a "merry action.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Boston Terrier -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/boston-terrier/" alt="AKC: Boston Terrier">Boston Terrier</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Boston Terrier.jpeg" width="400" height="400" alt="Boston Terrier"/><br>
                <p>Boston Terriers are compact, short-tailed, well-balanced little dogs weighing no more than 25 pounds. The stylish <q>tuxedo</q> coat can be white and either black, brindle, or seal (dark brown). The head is square, the muzzle is short, and the large, round eyes can shine with kindness, curiosity, or mischief. Ever alert to their surroundings, Bostons move with a jaunty, rhythmic step.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Labrador Retriever -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever/" alt="AKC: Labrador Retriever">Labrador Retriever</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Labrador Retriever.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Labrador Retriever"/><br>
                <p>The Labrador Retriever is a strongly built, medium-sized, short-coupled, dog possessing a sound, athletic, well-balanced conformation that enables it to function as a retrieving gun dog; the substance and soundness to hunt waterfowl or upland game for long hours under difficult conditions; the character and quality to win in the show ring; and the temperament to be a family companion. Physical features and mental characteristics should denote a dog bred to perform as an efficient Retriever of game with a stable temperament suitable for a variety of pursuits beyond the hunting environment.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Beagle -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/beagle/" alt="AKC: Beagle">Beagle</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Beagle.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Beagle"/><br>
                <p>There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and "big for their inches," as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as "merry" by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable, happy, and companionable—all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require plenty of playtime.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Havanese -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/havanese/" alt="AKC: Havanese">Havanese</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Havanese.jpeg" width="400" height="400" alt="Havanese"/><br>
                <p>Distinctive features of the Havanese include a curled-over tail and a gorgeous silky coat, which comes in a variety of colors. Some owners enjoy cording the coat, in the manner of a Puli, and others clip it short to reduce grooming time. Happily, Havenese are just as cute no matter what hairdo you give them.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- English Springler Spaniel -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/english-springer-spaniel/" alt="AKC: English Springer Spaniel">English Springer Spaniel</a></h2>
                <img src="images/English Springer Spaniel.jpeg" width="400" height="400" alt="English Springer Spaniel"/><br>
                <p>Built for long days in the field, English Springer Spaniels are tough, muscular hunters standing 19 to 20 inches at the shoulder and weighing between 40 and 50 pounds. The double coat comes in several colors and patterns, the ears are long and lush, and the kindly, trusting expression of the eyes is a cherished hallmark of the breed. Springers move with a smooth, ground-covering stride.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Bulldog -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bulldog/" alt="AKC: Bulldog">Bulldog</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Bulldog.jpeg" width="400" height="400" alt="Bulldog"/><br>
                <p>You can<sup>'</sup>t mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the distinctive rolling gait all practically scream "I'm a Bulldog!" The coat, seen in a variety of colors and patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy. Bulldogs can weigh up to 50 pounds, but that won't stop them from curling up in your lap, or at least trying to.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Siberian Husky -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/" alt="AKC: Siberian Husky">Siberian Husky</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Siberian Husky.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Siberian Husky"/><br>
                <p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- French Bulldog -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/french-bulldog/" alt="AKC: French Bulldog">French Bulldog</a></h2>
                <img src="images/French Bulldog.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="French Bulldog"/><br>
                <p>The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for the large, erect <q>bat ears</q> that are the breed's trademark feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular.</p>
            </div>
            <!-- Border Collie -->
            <div>
                <h2><a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/border-collie/" alt="AKC: Border Collie">Border Collie</a></h2>
                <img src="images/Border Collie.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Border Collie"/><br>
                <p>Borders are athletic, medium-sized herders standing 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder. The overall look is that of a muscular but nimble worker unspoiled by passing fads. Both the rough coat and the smooth coat come in a variety of colors and patterns.</p>
            </div>
            <!--Mixed dog breeds-->

                <img src="images/Mixed Breed Dogs.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Mixed Dog Breed"/><br>
                <p>There is some evidence that mixed dog breeds are healthier than pure breeds. While they may not be the right choice for everyone, mixed breeds can be wonderful pets, and you know that your particular dog is one of a kind!</p>
